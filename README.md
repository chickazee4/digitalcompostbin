# digitalcompostbin
gradually destroy your unwanted files, silently. several downloads are available under Releases: you can choose the smaller .dll if you already have .NET Core and then run it as such:

    dotnet digitalcompostbin.dll /directory/you/want/destroyed

otherwise you can download your OS's respective file and then run

    digitalcompostbin(.exe) /directory/you/want/destroyed
    
the program will screw up the files more every hour if you leave it open. i recommend setting it as a startup program so you don't have to reopen it every time you start your computer. file backups are kept. don't put any empty files in the directory or files larger than about 255 MB (split them up into chunks if you have larger files). do not complain about it breaking your files, that is the point.
